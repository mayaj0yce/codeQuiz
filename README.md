# codeQuiz
quiz
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

<!-- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz -->
<!-- WHEN I click the start button -->
THEN a timer starts and 
<!-- I am presented with a question -->


<!-- WHEN I answer a question -->
<!-- THEN I am presented with another question -->
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered
 <!-- or the timer reaches 0 -->
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score



start timer on start click.
 5 sec sub for each wrong question 
on finish take the time left and use that as score
save the score and the initials into local storage
(need to look up how to 1. use local storage and save initials 2. get the clock to start on the click 3. use time for the score)

last I need to make sure the styling isnt dog
